Inspired by TV shows, video games and other stories, Cid is obsessed with becoming the Power Within Shadows, a person who exerts enormous power from the shadows. He spares no effort dedicating himself to that goal and takes great pride in his achievements. He appreciates other people's hard work and disdains those who rob power.

His followers believe him to be a brilliant mastermind when in reality his success comes from dumb luck, improvisation, and his superior combat prowess. In his civilian persona, Cid hates drawing attention, portraying himself as a below-average student. In his Shadow persona, he is obsessed with appearing cool and mysterious in front of his followers, muttering ominous lines and performing silly antics. More than a few of Cid's decisions are aimed at acting out various fantasies and story clich√©s he thinks are cool. For instance, his participation in the God of War Festival Tournament (under the false identity Jimina) was solely to fulfill his specific fantasy of being a mysterious fighter who is at first laughed at for being supposedly weak, but ultimately shocks everyone with his true strength.
